zone_validation.py - cross-timeframe validation for Sahi-style Key Levels.

A zone found in only one timeframe (e.g. a brief intraday cluster with no
multi-day support, or a composite zone today's session hasn't touched at
all) is treated as noise. A zone is VALIDATED when its price range
overlaps a zone from the OTHER timeframe -- i.e. both the composite
(multi-day) profile and today's intraday profile independently agree
there's real volume concentrated around that price.

This mirrors the existing HVN/LVN "today_pool + composite_pool" confirms
pattern already used in hvn-lvn-scanner's app.py, applied here to
Sahi-style collapsed zones (dicts with price_low/price_high/price_mode)
instead of raw HVN/LVN nodes.
